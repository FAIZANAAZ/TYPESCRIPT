//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters
// at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character
// combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace
// around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.




let whitespaces = " \n\tfaiza naaz\t\n";
